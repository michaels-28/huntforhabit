        directly, you can book a free consultation. You can ask me anything! 
        I want to educate you about online coaching and ensure you know 
        exactly what the process is before we start. It is also crucial 
        that we talk aboutâ€¦ YOU! If you decide you want to hire me as

        your goals, eating habits and your current routines. This way I 
        can begin to build a personalised programme for you and give you 
        tailored support.
